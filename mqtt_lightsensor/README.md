MQTT Lightsensor and Adafruit.IO
===========

The basic idea is to use an ESP8266, read analog inputs and publish the values via MQTT to the adafruit MQTT-broker.
Adafruit provides a nice dashboard with graphs, statistics and logs and all the other fancy stuff.

In this project, I used an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to measure light intesity over the time. This allowed me to find a better place for my yucca plant.
